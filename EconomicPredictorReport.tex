	\begin{abstract}
		This study develops predictive models for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) Official Cash Rate (OCR) decisions using comprehensive macroeconomic indicators spanning 2021-2025. Through implementation of both regression and classification approaches, the analysis achieves exceptional 98.2\% accuracy (R²) in predicting exact OCR levels with errors under 0.2 percentage points. The research captures a complete monetary policy cycle from COVID-era stimulus through aggressive inflation targeting to policy normalization. Advanced ensemble methods including gradient boosting, voting classifiers, and class-imbalance aware techniques were evaluated to optimize policy direction prediction. Feature importance analysis reveals the dominance of policy persistence and inflation expectations in driving RBNZ decisions, validating New Zealand's dual mandate framework effectiveness.

	\section{Introduction}
	
	The Reserve Bank of New Zealand operates under a dual mandate framework established in the Reserve Bank Act, balancing price stability through inflation targeting (1-3\% CPI) with broader economic objectives including employment maximization and financial stability. Understanding the systematic factors that drive Official Cash Rate decisions is crucial for financial market participants, policymakers, and economic researchers seeking to anticipate monetary policy responses.
	
	This research develops a comprehensive machine learning framework to predict OCR decisions using real-time economic indicators available to policymakers. The analysis period (2021-2025) encompasses an ideal complete monetary policy cycle: post-COVID ultra-low rates (0.25\%), aggressive tightening in response to 7.5\% inflation, and subsequent policy normalization as inflation returned to target.
	
	\subsection{Research Objectives}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Develop accurate predictive models for next-month OCR levels and policy direction changes
		\item Quantify the relative importance of dual mandate variables in systematic policy responses  
		\item Evaluate advanced ensemble learning methods for addressing class imbalance in policy decisions
		\item Analyze monetary policy transmission mechanisms through interest rate and housing market channels
		\item Provide a framework for evidence-based economic forecasting applicable to other central banks
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Research Contributions}
	This study contributes to the monetary policy literature by: (1) applying modern machine learning techniques to New Zealand's unique dual mandate framework, (2) achieving unprecedented accuracy in OCR prediction through comprehensive feature engineering, (3) demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble methods for imbalanced policy classification, and (4) providing quantitative validation of RBNZ's systematic policy approach during a critical economic period.
	
	\section{Literature Review and Economic Context}
	
	\subsection{Monetary Policy Reaction Functions}
	Central bank reaction functions, pioneered by Taylor (1993), provide the theoretical foundation for understanding systematic policy responses to economic conditions. The Taylor Rule suggests that central banks adjust interest rates in response to inflation gaps and output deviations, with modern extensions incorporating financial stability considerations and unconventional policy measures.
	
	Recent empirical work has expanded these frameworks to include forward-looking elements, policy persistence, and asymmetric responses to economic shocks. Machine learning applications to monetary policy prediction have emerged as computational capabilities have advanced, though few studies focus specifically on New Zealand's institutional framework.
	
	\subsection{New Zealand's Monetary Policy Framework}
	The RBNZ's Policy Targets Agreement establishes a 1-3\% inflation target with explicit consideration of employment outcomes following the 2018 legislation amendment. The central bank's approach emphasizes gradual policy adjustments, clear communication, and systematic responses to economic fundamentals.
	
	The 2021-2025 period represents an exceptional case study in monetary policy effectiveness. Beginning with emergency COVID-era accommodation (OCR at 0.25\%), the RBNZ implemented one of the most aggressive tightening cycles globally (reaching 5.5\%) in response to supply-driven inflation, before successfully engineering a policy normalization as inflation returned to target ranges.
	
	\subsection{Machine Learning in Economic Forecasting}
	The application of machine learning to economic forecasting has gained prominence due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data, capture non-linear relationships, and adapt to structural changes. Ensemble methods have proven particularly effective for economic prediction tasks, where model uncertainty and structural breaks are common concerns.
	
	\section{Data and Methodology}
	
	\subsection{Data Sources and Collection}
	Economic data was systematically collected from New Zealand's authoritative statistical agencies to ensure policy-relevant coverage:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Reserve Bank of New Zealand}: Official Cash Rate, core inflation (sectoral factor model), house price indices, floating mortgage rates, term deposit rates, Trade Weighted Index
		\item \textbf{Statistics New Zealand}: Consumer Price Index (quarterly), unemployment rate (quarterly)  
		\item \textbf{Real Estate Institute of New Zealand}: House price growth indicators
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Data Quality Assurance}: All variables represent information available to policymakers at decision time, ensuring realistic forecasting conditions. Quarterly series (unemployment, core inflation) were interpolated to monthly frequency using linear methods to maintain temporal consistency.
	
	\subsection{Dataset Characteristics}
	The final processed dataset comprises:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Temporal Coverage}: January 2021 - August 2025 (44 monthly observations)
		\item \textbf{Features}: 22 engineered economic indicators
		\item \textbf{Target Variables}: OCR\_next (regression), OCR\_direction (classification)
		\item \textbf{Missing Data}: <5\% after interpolation and forward-filling
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Feature Engineering}
	Comprehensive feature engineering was implemented to capture monetary policy dynamics and economic relationships:
	
	\subsubsection{Temporal Features}
	\begin{align}
		\text{OCR\_lag1}_t &= \text{OCR}_{t-1} \\
		\text{OCR\_lag2}_t &= \text{OCR}_{t-2}
	\end{align}
	
	\subsubsection{Change Indicators}
	\begin{align}
		\text{CPI\_change}_t &= \text{CPI\_pct}_t - \text{CPI\_pct}_{t-1} \\
		\text{Unemployment\_change}_t &= \text{UnemploymentRate}_t - \text{UnemploymentRate}_{t-1} \\
		\text{TWI\_change}_t &= \text{TWI}_t - \text{TWI}_{t-1}
	\end{align}
	
	\subsubsection{Momentum Indicators}
	\begin{align}
		\text{CPI\_3ma}_t &= \frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=0}^{2} \text{CPI\_pct}_{t-i} \\
		\text{HousePrice\_3ma}_t &= \frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=0}^{2} \text{HousePriceGrowth}_{t-i}
	\end{align}
	
	\subsubsection{Policy Transmission Variables}
	\begin{align}
		\text{Mortgage\_OCR\_spread}_t &= \text{FloatingMortgage}_t - \text{OCR}_t \\
		\text{Deposit\_OCR\_spread}_t &= \text{TermDeposit6M}_t - \text{OCR}_t
	\end{align}
	
	\subsubsection{Regime Indicators}
	\begin{align}
		\text{High\_Inflation}_t &= \mathbb{I}(\text{CPI\_pct}_t > 3.0) \\
		\text{High\_Unemployment}_t &= \mathbb{I}(\text{UnemploymentRate}_t > 5.0) \\
		\text{Tightening\_Cycle}_t &= \mathbb{I}(\text{OCR}_t > \text{OCR}_{t-1})
	\end{align}
	
	where $\mathbb{I}(\cdot)$ represents indicator functions for economic regime identification.
	
	\subsubsection{Volatility Measures}
	\begin{align}
		\text{CPI\_volatility}_t &= \text{std}_{6m}(\text{CPI\_pct}_t) \\
		\text{OCR\_volatility}_t &= \text{std}_{6m}(\text{OCR}_t)
	\end{align}
	
	\subsection{Target Variable Construction}
	\begin{align}
		\text{OCR\_next}_t &= \text{OCR}_{t+1} \\
		\text{OCR\_direction}_t &= \begin{cases}
			\text{up} & \text{if } \text{OCR}_{t+1} > \text{OCR}_t \\
			\text{down} & \text{if } \text{OCR}_{t+1} < \text{OCR}_t \\
			\text{same} & \text{if } \text{OCR}_{t+1} = \text{OCR}_t
		\end{cases}
	\end{align}
	
	\subsection{Modeling Framework}
	
	\subsubsection{Regression Models}
	For exact OCR level prediction:
	$$\text{OCR}_{t+1} = f(\mathbf{X}_t; \theta) + \epsilon_{t+1}$$
	
	where $\mathbf{X}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{22}$ represents the feature vector and $f(\cdot)$ is estimated using:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Linear Regression}: $f(\mathbf{X}_t) = \mathbf{X}_t^T \boldsymbol{\beta}$
		\item \textbf{Random Forest}: $f(\mathbf{X}_t) = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^{B} T_b(\mathbf{X}_t)$ where $T_b$ are bootstrap-trained trees
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Classification Models}
	For policy direction prediction:
	$$P(\text{Direction}_{t+1} = k | \mathbf{X}_t) = \frac{\exp(g_k(\mathbf{X}_t))}{\sum_{j} \exp(g_j(\mathbf{X}_t))}$$
	
	for $k \in \{\text{up}, \text{down}, \text{same}\}$, implemented using Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
	
	\subsubsection{Advanced Ensemble Methods}
	To address class imbalance (66\% "same", 27\% "up", 7\% "down"), several ensemble techniques were implemented:
	
	\textbf{Boosting Algorithms}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{AdaBoost}: Sequential weak learner combination with adaptive weighting
		\item \textbf{Gradient Boosting}: Sequential error correction through gradient descent
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Voting Classifiers}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Hard Voting}: Majority vote across Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-NN
		\item \textbf{Soft Voting}: Probability-weighted ensemble predictions
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Stacking}: Meta-learning approach using cross-validated base predictions as inputs to a Logistic Regression meta-learner.
	
	\textbf{Imbalanced Learning}: SMOTE oversampling and Balanced Random Forest for minority class enhancement.
	
	\subsection{Model Evaluation}
	\textbf{Regression Metrics}: R², RMSE, MAE
	\textbf{Classification Metrics}: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
	\textbf{Validation}: 80/20 train-test split with temporal ordering preserved
	
	\section{Results}
	
	\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}
	
	The exploratory analysis revealed clear economic patterns consistent with New Zealand's monetary policy cycle:
	
	\subsubsection{OCR Evolution}
	The OCR demonstrated the complete policy cycle: emergency accommodation at 0.25\% (2021), rapid tightening to 5.5\% (2022-2023), and normalization to 4.25\% (2024-2025).
	
	\subsubsection{Inflation Dynamics}
	Consumer Price Index peaked at 7.5\% (2022) before declining to 2.0\% by 2024, validating the effectiveness of the RBNZ's inflation targeting approach.
	
	\subsubsection{Economic Correlations}
	Strong correlations emerged supporting economic theory:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item OCR $\leftrightarrow$ Interest Rates: 0.99 (perfect transmission)
		\item OCR $\leftrightarrow$ House Prices: -0.85 (monetary policy impact)
		\item CPI $\leftrightarrow$ Unemployment: -0.75 (Phillips Curve)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Regression Model Performance}
	
	Both regression models achieved exceptional accuracy, with Linear Regression slightly outperforming Random Forest:
	
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\caption{Regression Model Performance}
		\begin{tabular}{lccc}
			\toprule
			Model & R² & RMSE & MAE \\
			\midrule

			Random Forest & 0.9626 & 0.2736 & 0.1966 \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	The Linear Regression model's 98.2\% R² represents exceptional performance for economic forecasting, with typical prediction errors under 0.2 percentage points. This accuracy level exceeds standard econometric models and demonstrates the strong systematic relationships in New Zealand's monetary policy framework.
	
	\subsection{Classification Model Results}
	
	\subsubsection{Baseline Performance}
	Initial classification models achieved modest accuracy due to class imbalance:
	
	\begin{table}[H]

			Model & Accuracy \\
			\midrule
			Random Forest & 0.500 \\
			Logistic Regression & 0.500 \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	\subsubsection{Advanced Ensemble Results}
	Ensemble methods significantly improved classification performance:
	
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
